# huskylens-test
Here is a simple Python code that communicates with the HuskyLens via I2C without using the huskylib library. This code polls the device and reads QR codes and color detection data.
This program uses the smbus2 library for I2C communication, so you will need to install it first if you don't have it already:
pip install smbus2
